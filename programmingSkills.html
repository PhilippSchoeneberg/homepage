                    <h3>Website for a marketing designer</h3>
                    <p>My most recent project was developing a website for marketing designer Jeanette Ulbricht.</p>
                    <p>The website has not been published yet, but as soon as it is, I will link to it here.</p>

                    <h3>Web application "Stadle"</h3>
                    <p>During my time at school, as part of the 'Public History' seminar, my classmates and I developed a web application that aims to familiarize the residents of the historic town of Stade with the history of their home town. Our application is modelled on the games Geoguessr and Wordle and tries to combine the best of both worlds. This is achieved by letting the player search for a historical object using pictures and historical facts, but keeping the interest high by limiting the quiz to one per day. We hope that this will encourage young people in particular to learn more about the history of their home town and make learning history more enjoyable.</p>

                    <h3>My Homepage</h3>
                    <p>My first website development project was to create a homepage for myself. This was because I wanted to get a basic understanding of the programming languages CSS, HTML and JavaScript. I also wanted to create a more individual and free internet presence away from social media and their scripted profiles. To fill the website with some content, I thought about maybe using it as an alternative application format. To make it even more interesting, I tried to get my website online with as little cost as possible, so in the end I only paid for the domain name. If you know a way around this, feel free to contact me. But no, I do not want to use my IP address instead. It is just too inconvenient :)</p>
                    <p>If you liked my homepage so far, feel free to explore it further or contact me if you have any questions or suggestions.</p>

                    <h3>Indie maze game "Smiley's Adventure"</h3>
                    <p>When I was younger, one of my first game development projects was a game called "Smiley's Adventures", which I made using Scratch. It is an indie maze game about a Smiley who solves a maze by avoiding his enemies and collecting coins to unlock the location of the apple that teleports him to the next level.</p>
                    <p>It is published on the official Scratch site and if you'd like to give it a try, you can do so by clicking <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/311537676" title="Click here to get to the game!" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
