                <h2>Biography</h2>
                <p>Hello! My name is Philipp Schöneberg, and I am a dual student at the Dualen Hochschule Baden Wüttenberg (DHBW) in Mannheim and the German Aerospace Center (DLR). There I am studying computer science with a focus on artificial intelligence. In my free time, I really enjoy meeting up with friends or thinking about the world and the cosmos. Therefore, I was doing a lot of research in my years as a pupil at the Gymnasium Athenaeum in Stade where I completed my Abitur this June. While some of my projects were done in the context of Jugend forscht others were presented in the form of talks, posters and articles in the German Physical Society. You can find those projects as well as some I did in private here on my website. Enjoy and have fun!</p>
